                    <h3>Alexa Smith</h3>
                    <p>I started my ceramics journey in elementary school with my first coil pot. It didn’t take me long to figure out I could make tiny replicas of things around me using polymer clay and bake them in my parent’s toaster oven. I was reintroduced to pottery in high school where I became interested in replicating natural textures using handbuilt forms and slip decoration techniques. While managing University of Maryland’s ceramic studio, I discovered my love of glaze chemistry, a deep appreciation for a working pug mill, and the satisfaction of a tightly packed kiln. Most importantly, I witnessed how playing with clay both relieved stress and brought people together in a humbling and quite literally “down to earth” way. Although I pursued a career as a Fire Protection Engineer after graduation, I could never quite keep my hands out of clay for too long. While I consider myself a hand-builder at heart- I am the proud owner of a 1972 Shimpo RK-2 wheel- affectionately named “Tina”. I have always felt that clay is one of the most fun and stress relieving mediums to work with, and have loved sharing that joy with other people over my six years of working in various pottery studios.
