Cat has known she wanted to open up a pottery studio in Jacksonville as soon as she started her career in the arts. She started off taking a pottery class in her home town Tampa, at the Academy of the Holy Names High School. She instantly knew this was her calling but she also learned as she went on to college her love of business and management. Cat started her degree in management, but it was her love of being an athlete rower and ceramicists where she found herself transferring to Jacksonville University. </p>

She then took on teaching throwing classes at a local non profit art center and made her way with Cat Scratch in selling her work at local markets, but her love was really in spreading her love of teaching and she knew Jacksonville was in need of a Pottery studio.

                        <p>Jacksonville native and neighborhood face, Cal Cook is an artist and educator who has been teaching ceramics through local art centers since 2017. He graduated from UNF in 2015 with his BFA in studio ceramics, acquiring a balanced skill set of wheel throwing, hand building, and mold making. Now a secondary teacher in Green Cove Springs, Cal works closely with grades 9-12; helping hone their 2D art skills and art history knowledge.</p>
                        <p>

A fragrance enthusiast, Cal enjoys experimenting with olfactory concepts through perfume and candle making. His favorite scent profiles are those that are earthy, green, and often polarizing. A jack of all mediums, Cal also occasionally dabbles in photographic processes, 2D design, and textile work.

                         As far as personal work and style, Cal’s ceramics are made with function in mind as he caters to utility and necessity by way of porcelain and stonewares. His concepts are simple, with works featuring quiet colors and haphazard imagery concerning mundane yet relatable sentiments. He enjoys making lumpy mugs, things that hold flowers, and things that hold food. You can find him and his work on Instagram @calcookceramics.

                        <h3>Alexa Smith</h3>
                        <p>I started my ceramics journey in elementary school with my first coil pot. It didn’t take me long to figure out I could make tiny replicas of things around me using polymer clay and bake them in my parent’s toaster oven. I was reintroduced to pottery in high school where I became interested in replicating natural textures using handbuilt forms and slip decoration techniques. While managing University of Maryland’s ceramic studio, I discovered my love of glaze chemistry, a deep appreciation for a working pug mill, and the satisfaction of a tightly packed kiln. Most importantly, I witnessed how playing with clay both relieved stress and brought people together in a humbling and quite literally “down to earth” way. Although I pursued a career as a Fire Protection Engineer after graduation, I could never quite keep my hands out of clay for too long. While I consider myself a hand-builder at heart- I am the proud owner of a 1972 Shimpo RK-2 wheel- affectionately named “Tina”. I have always felt that clay is one of the most fun and stress relieving mediums to work with, and have loved sharing that joy with other people over my six years of working in various pottery studios.
